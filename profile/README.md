# Brilliant
## We’re a lean and versatile embedded team, excelling in e-commerce, tech and design.

Brilliant was born from a simple idea: why should exceptional e-commerce be reserved for the big players?

Founded by Alex Leclair and Olivier M. Chan Kane, we bring both creative vision and technological expertise through UX and UI design, balancing beautiful aesthetics with conversion-focused functionality. Think of us as the team making sure every solution works flawlessly for both your customers and your team.

Like a brilliant chess move ("!!" for the chess nerds out there), we deliver strategic solutions that truly shine. Having helped numerous brands navigate the crucial—and often wild—transition from small to medium-sized operations, we understand the challenges and opportunities that come with scaling your online business.

At Brilliant, we don't just build websites—we build partnerships that help ambitious e-commerce brands reach their full potential.
